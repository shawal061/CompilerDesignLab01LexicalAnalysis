# Tokenizer Lab Code

This repository contains two versions of a C program that tokenizes input from a file into identifiers, numbers, and special characters. 

## Description

- **Lab01.c**:  
   The initial version implemented during the lab session. This version is functional but has some limitations, such as fixed buffer sizes and less efficient memory handling.

- **UpdatedLab01.c**:  
   An optimized version with the following enhancements:
   - **Dynamic memory allocation** with `realloc` to handle larger input files safely.
   - Replaced inefficient functions like `strncat` with direct buffer indexing.
   - Added checks to prevent buffer overflows.
   - Improved maintainability and readability using cleaner code practices.

## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run either version, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal in the directory containing the code files.
2. Use the `gcc` compiler to compile the program:

   For the **Lab01 version**:
   ```bash
   gcc Lab01.c -o Lab01
   ./Lab01
   ```

   For the **UpdatedLab01 version**:
   ```bash
   gcc UpdatedLab01.c -o UpdatedLab01
   ./UpdatedLab01
   ```

3. Ensure you have the required input files (`input.txt` or `inputx.txt`) in the same directory, as the program reads input from these files and writes output to `output.txt` or `outputx.txt`.

## Input and Output Example

### Sample Input (`input.txt`):
```
int main() {    
	int a, b, c;
	b= 10;
	c= 5;
	a = b+c;
	printf("%d", a);
}
```

### Output (`output.txt`):
```
int
main
(
)
{
int
a
,
b
,
c
;
b
=
10
;
c
=
5
;
a
=
b
+
c
;
printf
(
"
%
d
"
,
a
)
;
}
```

### Alternate Input (`inputx.txt`):
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    double a, b, product;
    printf("Enter two numbers: ");
    scanf("%lf %lf", &a, &b);  
 
    // Calculating product
    product = a * b;

    // %.2lf displays number up to 2 decimal point
    printf("Product = %.2lf", product);
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Output (`outputx.txt`):
```
#
include
<
stdio
.

>
int
main
(
)
{
double
a
,
b
,
product
;

}
```

## Why Two Versions?

The two versions demonstrate the process of improving a working program by:
- Identifying limitations in the original implementation.
- Applying better memory management and coding practices.
- Ensuring the program is more efficient, scalable, and maintainable.
